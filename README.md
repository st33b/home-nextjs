This is my resume, built as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. 
It was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I use it both as a resume and as a tool for continuing to refine my 
skills with React, Sass, and Bootstrap.

In this instance, I've opted for NPM over Yarn.

## Running it locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
